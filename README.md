Market Research Report: FMCG Demand Forecasting Analysis
1. Executive Summary
This report presents a detailed market analysis of FMCG sales patterns based on a dataset containing 1,000 transactional records. We explore trends by category, promotional impact, location-specific demand, and relationships between sales drivers, price, stock, and supplier cost.
2. Outlier Detection in Sales Volume
A box plot of 'Sales Volume' reveals moderate to high variability with a few outliers. The central 50% of values lie between 500 and 1,500 units. These outliers may indicate exceptional promotional success or inventory anomalies, warranting further review for accurate forecasting.
3. Product Category Performance
Beverages lead all categories in total sales volume, followed closely by Personal Care and Household goods. While Snacks account for the least volume, the difference is marginal, reflecting a balanced overall category mix.
4. Price vs Sales Volume
There is no strong correlation between price and sales volume across the dataset. Personal Care products span a wide price range up to $500, suggesting brand strength and premium consumer acceptance. Other categories are priced more uniformly under $20, reflecting commodity pricing and greater price sensitivity.
5. Promotion Effectiveness
Promotions show a marginal increase in average sales volume, but not significantly. This suggests that promotional success depends on factors such as timing, product category, and regional preferences rather than discounts alone.
6. Store Location Demand Insights
Urban store locations lead in sales volume (35.2%), followed by Rural (32.7%) and Suburban (32.1%) areas. Marketing efforts and stock allocation should focus on urban zones, while tailoring strategies to suburban and rural nuances.
7. Correlation Matrix Summary
The correlation between key numeric variables such as price, supplier cost, and stock level with sales volume is very weak. This implies external or categorical variables—such as promotions, product type, or time-based effects—are stronger sales drivers.
8. Monthly Sales Trends
Sales volumes fluctuate month-to-month, with evident peaks and dips indicating demand seasonality. These patterns can be linked to holidays, promotions, or supply chain factors and should guide inventory planning.
9. Strategic Recommendations
- Leverage Beverages and Personal Care for premium pricing and bundling opportunities.
- Investigate personalized promotions, especially for lower-performing segments like Snacks.
- Monitor urban sales trends more closely and use targeted marketing in rural zones.
- Incorporate seasonality trends into inventory forecasting to improve service levels and reduce stockouts.
